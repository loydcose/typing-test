          There were little things that she simply could not stand. The sound of someone tapping their nails on the table. A person chewing with their
          mouth open. Another human imposing themselves into her space. She couldn't stand any of these things, but none of them compared to the
          number one thing she couldn't stand which topped all of them combined. The desert wind blew the tumbleweed in front of the car. Alex swerved
          to avoid the tumbleweed, but he turned the wheel a bit too strong and the car left the road and skidded onto the dirt median. He instantly
          slammed on the brakes and the car stopped in a cloud of dirt. When the dust cloud had settled and he could see around him again, he realized
          that he'd somehow crossed over into an entirely new dimension. There was no ring on his finger. That was a good sign although far from proof
          that he was available. Still, it was much better than if he had been wearing a wedding ring on his hand. She glanced at his hand a bit more
          intently to see if there were any tan lines where a ring may have been, and he's simply taken it off. She couldn't detect any which was also
          a good sign and a relief. The next step would be to get access to his wallet to see if there were any family photos in it.
